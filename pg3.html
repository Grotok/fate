                <p>You hold your breath and wait……a low moan seems to emanate from within the shattered door. Slowly it builds to a shrill keening.
                     The hair on the back of your neck stands on end. An answering shriek from behind you sets your instincts into motion.
                      Leaping forward, you tuck and roll, spinning around as you come back to your feet. Peering out into the gloom of the night you see nothing.
                       The moaning has stopped, the only thing you hear now is the thundering of your heart.
                        You take a few deep breaths to steady yourself and take stock of your surroundings.</p> 
                    <p>You are in a grand foyer. Broad stairs sweep up to your left and right coming together on a central balcony.
                     There are torches lining the walls every few feet, some casting an eerie green glow that bathes the area in unease.
                      There are doors to the left and right of you at the foot of each stairway. 
                      In front of you a good distance away is a set of large double doors flanked by halberd wielding suits of armor. 
                      A strange symbol is carved above the double doors, it almost seems to be glowing. There is one more door on the right hand side leading under the stairs. 
                      It lies midway between you and the knights.
